## Adnominal possesion: A LinGO Grammar Matrix library

In 2018, I wrote a library that extended the [LinGO Grammar Matrix](http://matrix.ling.washington.edu/index.html) to cover adnominal possessive phrases. 

The Grammar Matrix is an svn-based project, and the code can be checked out here: 

`svn co --username guest svn://lemur.ling.washington.edu/shared/matrix/trunk`

If you want to try out using the Grammar Matrix, you can visit the [matrix customization page](http://matrix.ling.washington.edu/customize/matrix.cgi).

If you want to read about the adnominal possession library, you can check out my thesis (`thesis.pdf`) or the paper I presented with Emily Bender at HPSG 2018 (`hpsg2018.pdf`).
